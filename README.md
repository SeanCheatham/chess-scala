# Welcome to Scala Chess!
This library aims to serve two purposes:
    - Implement an effective chess engine using the Scala language
    - Provide a practical implementation, while also providing educational value

## Contributing
Users are more than welcome to contribute to this library.  It is open source, and you are
free to use the code as you please.  When contributing to the project, please follow these guidelines:
    - Document code whenever possible.  This is an "educational" library, so providing comments and notes will be very helpful
    - Use a functional programming style whenever possible; however, since this is a chess engine, efficiency is also critical.  If efficiency would be sacrificed just for the sake of FP, don't use FP.

## Installing
### git
This library is stored as a [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository.  git is a version control system, and is easy to [install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Scala
The language of this library is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), a functional/object-oriented hybrid programming language which runs on the JVM (like Java).
Scala can be [installed](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) and run from the command line; however, the library is built using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  Installation docs [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html)

### IntelliJ
In my opinion, the easiest and best way to use this library is to simply install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
IntelliJ is an IDE with an excellent Scala plugin.  Installing IntelliJ with this plugin removes the need to install Scala or SBT, as it will be bundled with the IDE.
